# swapping-of-no.s-without-temperory-variable
Developed by shraddhatech16 , In this code we are not using any temporary variable Instead of that we have to just make equations which contains a&amp;b With the help of these three equations i.e. 1.a=a+b ,b=a-b , &amp; a=a-b we can run the program and swap the no.s
